## Intriduction

The Trinket Torch was created for a production of Shrek that required a mob to have torches and pitchforks. The design was based on the 5V version of the adafruit Trinket (https://www.adafruit.com/product/1501). It uses a small fan, 5 NeoPixel LEDs (RGBW), a 3d Printed housing and some white China-Silk
